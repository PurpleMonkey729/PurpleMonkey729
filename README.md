## 😄About Me😄
Hello! This is Yoshimura Hiroki. I am a "DEV FAN", not a "senior engineer". My greatest joy is when I complete a sophisticated and powerful web project. During the 8 years of web development, I received a lot of help and helped others a lot. The state of the art technology is important, but passion and cooperation are more important, I think.
